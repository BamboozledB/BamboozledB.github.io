My short term goals would be to start being more productive with my classes!
Adding onto that, I would like to take online collage courses. Another short-term goal
of mine would be to start getting out and work out more.

        <div class="goal2">
           My future goals are to learn how to progress more in ceramics.
           I've taken a ceramics class this year and it's been pretty educational. 
           I want to further my learning in this creative area!
