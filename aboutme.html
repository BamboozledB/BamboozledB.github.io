    <main class="aboutme"> 
        I come from Nevada but I moved to Utah about a year ago. 
        Originally, I lived in Utah until I was about 6 before moving to Nevada.
        My family decided that it was time for us to move back to be closer to family. 
        I really love drawing and anything to do with art. 
        My favorite subject in school would probably be Art and Psychology.
        When I graduate, I would love to do something that includes the arts.
        My favorite animal would be cats and foxes!
